 Now update your hosts file (ansible_port and ansible_ssh_private_key_file) with the value you got from vagrant ssh-config command
## check if you are getting ip from your interfaces
```
ansible-playbook ./open5gs/test/debug.yaml -i hosts
```
```console
ansible all -m ping -i hosts
```
if got success output it means your machine is reachable.
you can also use debug.yaml file with your need.

To deploy go to each role and follow instructions
